After completing the 2025 MOOC Python course (offered by University of Helsinki) I created a simple application to review what I had learned during the course. Using the application, one can input names and birthday of people to find out who is the oldest and who is the youngest. The course although extensive was very well structed, and with some javascript and c# coding knowledge I was very quickly able to grasp the Python programming language using this course, which I highly recommend (it's free).
