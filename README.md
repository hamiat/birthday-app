After completing the 2025 MOOC Python course (offered by University of Helsinki) I created a simple application to review what I had learned during the course. The course was thorough and very well structed, with prior javascript/typescript and c# coding knowledge I was very quickly able to grasp the Python programming language using this course, which I highly recommend (it's free).

The app: input names and birthday of people to find out who is the oldest and who is the youngest.
